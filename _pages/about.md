About Me
------
Hi! I am **Ansong Ni (倪安松)**, a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://cpsc.yale.edu) at [Yale University](https://yale.edu) working with [Prof. Dragomir Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev) in the [LILY](https://yale-lily.github.io) lab. 
Prior to Yale, I obtained my M.S. in CS degree from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu) and B.Eng. from [Nanjing University](https:ww.//nju.edu.cn) in China.

I worked as a research intern at [Microsoft Research Redmond](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/deep-learning-group) (Summer 2021), [Allen Institute for AI (AI2)](https://allenai.org) (Summer 2020), [Institute for Software Research at CMU](https://www.isri.cmu.edu/) (Spring 2020), [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (Summer, Fall 2017).

Research Interest
------
I am generally interesting in natural language process and machine learning. My long-term research goal is to build a system that can <u>be programmed and instructed through natural language</u> and respond to satisfy our demands. 
Motivated by this goal, I am mainly interested in the following topics:
 * **Semantic Parsing \| Code Generation \| Program Synthesis**
 * **Question Answering \| Reading Comprehension**
 * **Dialogue System \| Text Generation**
