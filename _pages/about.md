Hi! I am a master's student in the 
[School of Computer Science](https://cs.cmu.edu){:target="_blank"}
at 
[Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu){:target="_blank"}
working with 
[Prof. Graham Neubig](http://phontron.com/index.php){:target="_blank"}
on **semantic parsing**.
Previously, I worked on the topic of machine learning for software engineering with 
[Prof. Ming Li](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/lim){:target="_blank"}
 and interned at
[Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/){:target="_blank"}
, mentored by 
[Senior Research Shi Han](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/shihan/){:target="_blank"}.

Research Interest
------
My research goal is to build a system that can <u> learn to understand human language </u> and respond to satisfy our demands. 
Motivated by this goal, my focus of research areas are natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), especially:
 * **Grounded Semantic Parsing/Code Generation/Program Synthesis**
 * **(Inter)active Learning**
 * **Learning from weak supervision**
