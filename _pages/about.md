About Me
------
Hi! I am **Ansong Ni (倪安松)**, a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://cpsc.yale.edu) at [Yale University](https://yale.edu) working with [Prof. Dragomir Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev) in the [LILY](https://yale-lily.github.io) lab. 
Prior to Yale, I obtained my M.S. in CS degree from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu) and B.Eng. from [Nanjing University](https:ww.//nju.edu.cn) in China.

I worked as a research intern at [Meta AI](https://www.facebook.com/MetaAI/) (Summer 2022), [Microsoft Research Redmond](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/deep-learning-group) (Summer 2021), [Allen Institute for AI (AI2)](https://allenai.org) (Summer 2020), [Institute for Software Research at CMU](https://www.isri.cmu.edu/) (Spring 2020), [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (Summer, Fall 2017). I will be interning at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/) for Summer 2023.

Research Interest
------
I am generally interested in natural language processing and machine learning. My long-term research goal is to build a system that can <u>understand user intent and parse it into machine-executable form</u>. 
Motivated by this goal, I am mainly interested in topics as program synthesis, semantic parsing, and neuro-symbolic methods. You can know more by referring to the publication list below.
