Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in the 
[Computer Science Department](https://cpsc.yale.edu){:target="_blank"}
at 
[Yale University](https://yale.edu){:target="_blank"}
woring with
[Prof. Dragomir Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev){:target="_blank"}
in the 
[LILY](https://yale-lily.github.io){:target="_blank"}
lab. 
I obtained my M.S. in CS degree from 
[School of Computer Science](https://cs.cmu.edu){:target="_blank"}
at 
[Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu){:target="_blank"}
working with 
[Prof. Graham Neubig](http://phontron.com/index.php){:target="_blank"}
on semantic parsing.
Previously, I worked on the topic of machine learning for software engineering with 
[Prof. Ming Li](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/lim){:target="_blank"} in my undergraduate.

Research Interest
------
My research goal is to build a system that can <u> learn to understand human language </u> and respond to satisfy our demands. 
Motivated by this goal, my focus of research area is natural language understanding (NLU), especially:
 * **Semantic Parsing/Code Generation/Program Synthesis**
 * **Question Answering/Reading Comprehension**
