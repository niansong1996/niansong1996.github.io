About Me
------
Hi! I am **Ansong Ni (倪安松)**, a final-year Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://cpsc.yale.edu) at [Yale University](https://yale.edu) working with [Prof. Arman Cohan](https://armancohan.com/), and (the late) [Prof. Dragomir Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev). 
Prior to Yale, I obtained my M.S. in CS degree from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu) and B.Eng. from [Nanjing University](https:ww.//nju.edu.cn) in China.

I worked as a research intern at **[Google DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/)** (Summer 2023), **[Meta AI](https://www.facebook.com/MetaAI/)** (Summer 2022), **[MSR Redmond](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/deep-learning-group)** (Summer 2021), **[AI2](https://allenai.org)** (Summer 2020), **[MSR Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/)** (Summer, Fall 2017).

**I will be on the job market in Fall 2023 for industrial research labs & startups.**

Research Interest
------
My current research focus is **code generation using large language models (LLMs)**. More specifically, 
I am intrigued by the abilities / applications enabled by LLMs trained on code, such as:
* Procedure understanding and reasoning ([ICLR'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14318))
* AI-assisted software development (ICSE'21, MSR'17)
* Tool use and robot control 

I am also excited by the various learning problems posted by code LLMs, such as: 
* Learning from execution feedback (ICLR'23, ICML'23) 
* Neuro-symbolic learning (ICLR'23)
* (inter-)active learning (AAAI'20), Transfer Learning (DL4C'23, ICML'23), Multi-task Learning (EMNLP'22)*

Previously, I have also done research in more traditional NLP tasks, such as question answering (EMNLP'21) and text summarization (EMNLP'21, ACL'22, EMNLP'22). I also led the development of [SummerTime](https://github.com/Yale-LILY/SummerTime) (230+ stars) at Yale.

For more details about my research, please refer to my publication list below.
